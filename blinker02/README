This expands on the blinker01 example by using a timer in the cortex-m.

The cortex-m0 has a system timer in the arm core itself, one that is
very simple to use.  There are actually two examples here one simply
looks at a bit in the timer which is a state change about once a second.
The other uses the timer to count out multiple seconds assuming an 8MHz
clock.  The docs tell us that the internal clock is 8MHz, and the external
clock from the schematic is also 8MHz.

The experiment shows that the clock is 8Mhz with 10 seconds on one led and
1 second on the other then repeat.
