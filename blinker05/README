Derived from prior blinker examples.  First the gpio for the leds is
setup.  Then the external 8mhz clock is enabled and selected.  The leds
are blinked a few times using this clock driving the system.  Then
the pll is setup to multiply the external clock by 6, 8*6=48MHz the
fastest rate for this part.  Then the leds are blinked using that
system clock.  Notice the blink rate change by using a different
clock.
