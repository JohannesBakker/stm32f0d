This example uses PA9 AF1 as USART1_TX.
This example uses PA10 AF1 as USART1_RX.

This is based on uart01 and blinker02, it takes the clock init routine
from blinker02, changing from internal 8mhz clock to external 8mhz clock.
And uart init information from uart01.

Whatever character comes in the RX is echoed back out the TX.  Carriage
returns are echoed with an additional line feed.
