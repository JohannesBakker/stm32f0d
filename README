stm32f0 discovyer examples

This repository is a collection of examples for use on the stm32f0
discovery board.

Retails for $7.99 plus shipping.

Under the design support tab you will find a schematic zip file which
as of this writing simply includes one pdf file.  From the schematics
the part number for the part we are using is STM32F051R8T6

go to the page that comes up for that part.

Under the design support tab download the datasheet DS8668, note that
the document number is not part of the filename.  You will also
want the reference manual RM0091 and the programming manual PM0215.
For information on the serial bootloader add AN2606 and AN3155.

Go to the bottom of the datasheet, under part numbering.  The R means
64 pin, the 8 means 64Kbytes.  The T means LQFP.

For the uart examples we need to know the pins for tx and rx.  Searching
through the document you find that
PA9 is USART1_TX alternate function 1
PA10 is USART1_RX alternate function 1
PB6 is USART1_TX alternate function 0
PB7 is USART1_RX alternate function 0

This board uses a version 2 (V2) stlink interface, what that really
is there is another microcontroller on the board, that handles the
usb side of things, this one you do not develop for.  It allows us to
access the hardware debugger in the stm32f0 part that we are here to
program.  This includes loading and running programs in ram and loading
programs into flash to be run on reset or power up.

No doubt there are closed source windows solutions, but I am interested
in open source linux solutions.  The main place to go for this is

https://github.com/texane/stlink

I am not a fan of gdb, but am a fan of jtag debugging there is support
for the stmf0 through openocd which is the popular open source jtag
utility for arm.  Note we are not directly manipulating the jtag on the
stm32f0 part, we are talking to the stlink microcontroller which is
manipulating the jtag on the stm32f0 for us.

Openocd home

http://openocd.sourceforge.net/

git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd
or
git clone git://repo.or.cz/openocd.git
or
git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/openocd.git

then

cd openocd
./boostrap
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
or
../configure --prefix=SOMEDIR
make
sudo make install

In various places in this document you will find an openocd config file
stm32f0discovery.cfg, this is derived from the stock openocd config.
The stock one simply points at two other files in openocd, instead I
pulled the three files and made one complete one that doesnt need to
go find anything else.  Personal preference no other reason.

As of this writing I dont know if there is support for writing the flash
using openocd.  These examples will only use it to load and run programs
in ram.

To load a program in sram and run it the simplest way to do it is to
have one terminal for the openocd server.  Change to the directory
that contains your binary file (elf format), this way you dont have to
type in a path, then with openocd in your path

openocd -f stm32f0discovery.cfg

it will connect and mention some breakpoints and such.

In another terminal, doesnt matter what directory it is in,

telnet localhost 4444

This should connect to the other and you should see both screens reflect
the connection.  IF THE CONNECTION WORKS then

> halt
> load_image blinker01.gcc.thumb.elf
> resume 0x20000000


These parts also include a serial bootloader, I have used this
bootloader before with another board.  Verifying that code on this
board is a work in progress, will update the README when it works.

-----------------

Start with the blinker examples, sram directories.

My examples do not initialize .bss nor do I use .data.  To understand
how that affects you see the bssdata directory in my raspberry pi repo
http://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi  then go to the bssdata repo and
read the README.
