This example uses PA9 AF1 as USART1_TX.

USART1 and gpioa need to be enabled.  Then looking at the gpio table
we are interested in AF push pull.  The settings are listed in the
port bit configuration table in the reference manual.

The baud rate setting for this uart is simple.  From blinker02 we know
the part comes up using an 8Mhz clock. So 8000000 / 115200 = 69.

If all the usart registers are zeros (with a few exceptions) then we
get 8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit.  Toggling the reset bit in
the RCC puts the usart at the reset values which is zeros in all of
these registers.  Then set the baud rate, and enable the transmitter
and the uart in general.
