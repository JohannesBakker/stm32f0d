This example uses PA9 AF1 as USART1_TX.
This example uses PA10 AF1 as USART1_RX (not really used)

The uart part is based on uart02.  8MHz external clock, uart is 115200
baud 8N1.  Timer from blinker02.

I have one of these stepper motors

And one of these, modified for 3.3Volt.

(or any other 3.3volt uart/serial solution).

Fairly trivial.  The processor is running 8 mhz, so 1 microsecond is
8000 ticks of the arm timer.  servo commands are simple pulses from 0.5
to 2.5 ms (ideally repeated every 20ms) so that would be 4000 to 20000
ticks.  This servo is not a complete 180 degrees it is more like 160,
so it doesnt quite make the full 4000 to 20000 timer ticks.

I am driving the servo completely from board, using the 5v from usb and
a ground. then using the led output pc9 for the pulses.  So far the
usb power has been able to drive this thing and not harm the computer or
this board (or servo).  Try this at your own risk it is your computer
mobo you might fry...

This variant takes characters from the uart, Z/X rotate in large steps,
A/S rotate in not as big, Q/W smaller and 1/2 even smaller.
