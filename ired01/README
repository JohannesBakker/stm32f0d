This example demonstrates how to use an ir receiver module, specifically

The first step in decoding ir is making sure you have your gpio setup
and are receiving something from the receiver.  Blinking an led is not
a bad way to do this.  You may need to experiment with your receiver
and have the led on when the receiver is on or led off when the receiver
is on depending on the blink you want.  In this case we have two leds
and can have one match the receiver and one inverted.  With the above
receiver the green led should be on normally and the blue blink on when
it is detecting ir pulses.

future examples will decode protocols.
