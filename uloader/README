See the README in the above directory for more information on
documentation for this board.

In particular AN2606 and AN3155 were used to develop/verify this
program.

You will want to connect your host uart to these pins.  NOT RS232
levels but 3 or 3.3V TTL.

PA9 is USART1_TX alternate function 1
PA10 is USART1_RX alternate function 1

Then you have to tie BOOT0 to 3V to pull it up.  Power on or press
the reset button and the part will boot into the internal bootloader.


    if(detect_chip()) return(1);
    if(get()) return(1);
    if(getverpstat()) return(1);
    if(getid()) return(1);

From the docs:

"Erase (0x43) and Extended Erase (0x44) are exclusive. A device may
support either the Erase command or the Extended Erase command but
not both."

The docs also say that this part should support V2.1 but the read out
shows version 3.1
