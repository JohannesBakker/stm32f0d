This example uses PA9 AF1 as USART1_TX.
This example uses PA10 AF1 as USART1_RX.
This example uses PA2 AF1 as USART2_TX.
This example uses PA3 AF1 as USART2_RX.

This is based on uart02 but uses both uarts.

Whatever character comes in the RX of one uart is echoed back out the
TX of the other uart.  Carriage returns are echoed with an additional
line feed.
